{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Lieudit": "Vozèmieux", "Varietal": "Chardonnay", "Comment": "The domaine currently has a 1.5 hectare parcel in Oger, Mesnil's neighboring village to the north. 66 ares of the 1.5 hectares are in the climat of \"Les Vozemieux\". (1 are is 1/100th of a hectare, so 66 ares is 0.66 hectare.) ** The vines in Les Vozemiux were planted in 1955.\n\nLes Vozemieux is a cuvée that has existed only since the 2010 vintage, Pierre decided to isolate this parcel which systematically stood out at the tasting. He wanted to see what difference, if any, there would be between his parcel of Chetillons in Mesnil and Les Vozemieux in Oger.\n\n\"This small parcel (66 ares) located in the area called Vozémieux and planted in 1955, it is always harvested last because it faces north. The grapes therefore take longer to ripen. It is a vintage which reveals its vintage in an exacerbated way, thanks to its location of course but also thanks to the use of indigenous yeasts.\" - Pierre Amillet\n\nThe Chardonnays are pressed and then vinified in a small 20 hl tuns just like in Les Chetillons. Only the cuvée (the first juices from the press) is used. Full malo is done and the wines stays in wood until the summer after harvest. \nThe wine is bottled the summer after harvest and aged on cork. No chapitalization or filtration. This wine is Extra Brut and close to being zero dosage.\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ 4.018905517751613, 48.948742162339634 ], [ 4.01811036188375, 48.950169085883331 ], [ 4.019319434504748, 48.950354259167625 ], [ 4.0202382, 48.9491879 ], [ 4.018905517751613, 48.948742162339634 ] ] ] ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Lieudit": "Chétillons", "Varietal": "Chardonnay", "Comment": "Les Chétillons is certainly the most famous of the Grand Cru village of Mesnil-sur-Oger. It is a parcel on which the chalk outcrops. There is hardly 20 cm of soil before arriving on pure white chalk. This absolutely unique terroir pushes the vine\nand forces it to plunge its roots deep into the soil. This is the prestige cuvée of the house and comes from five different parcels in the village of Mesnil totaling two hectares. The oldest parcels were  planted in 1956. (The entire climat of Les Chetillons is 40 hectares.)\n\n\"Les Chétillons parcel is emblematic of Mesnil-sur-Oger. It is a very easy plot to work. easy to work, there is never any disease. The Chardonnays that we obtain here give great wines for aging. The use of indigenous yeasts exacerbates the effect of the vintage effect\" - Pierre Amillet. \n\nThe Chardonnays from this parcel are vinified in 350 liter barrels, thus allowing to keep all the freshness, all the tension\ntension of the grapes. The wine is fermented in barrel and undergoes malolactic fermentation. It is bottled the summer after harvest and is aged on cork before being disgorged. The wine is not chaptalized or filtered and is zero dosage. After bottling, the wine spends at least 5 years in the cellars of the of the house before being marketed. Its dosage is very light, in the order of 2 to 3 g per liter.\n\nSince 2012 Pierre has made Chetillons every year. There was no Chetillons produced in '09, '10, or ’11.\n" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ 4.0298863, 48.943497 ], [ 4.0300141, 48.9481068 ], [ 4.03173, 48.9486642 ], [ 4.0316533, 48.9491757 ], [ 4.0320386, 48.9492908 ], [ 4.0337672, 48.9472835 ], [ 4.0345212, 48.9459541 ], [ 4.0348002, 48.9454322 ], [ 4.0364345, 48.9430287 ], [ 4.0343393, 48.9423091 ], [ 4.0342072, 48.9424198 ], [ 4.0331796, 48.9420958 ], [ 4.032829, 48.9422935 ], [ 4.030721, 48.941908 ], [ 4.0298863, 48.943497 ] ] ] ] } }
