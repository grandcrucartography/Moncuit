They began purchasing land in 1889 and by 1928 were bottling at the domaine.\n\nRobert Moncuit's grandson, Pierre Amillet is the current winemaker and the fourth generation to lead the winery. He took over in 2000. Before Pierre took over they were selling off around 1/3 of their fruit every year and bottling only 2/3. \n\nThe estate has 8 hectares planted in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger and 2 hectares in Oger. All the wines assume optimum maturity, through fermentation in barrels (350 liters), systematic malolactic fermentation, aging of three years for the brut and five years for the vintages, aged for their part in a cork stopper. \n" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ 4.031410679414006, 48.949430770677196 ], [ 4.0312588, 48.9492338 ], [ 4.031239483319511, 48.948922217572964 ], [ 4.0315776, 48.9489627 ], [ 4.0316533, 48.9491757 ], [ 4.031677543914248, 48.94931496155445 ], [ 4.031410679414006, 48.949430770677196 ] ] ] ] } }
